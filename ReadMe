Pharmaceutical sorting plant Describe how it works
Machine: Color Sorter, Robot Arm1. 
1. Recognize the color of block by color sensor of color sorter
2. . Put up to 8 blocks(maximum) into the sorter and operate 
3. Sort blocks into boxes by color 
4. Color Sorter converts the color and count data of a block into JSON Publish to IBM cloud
5. The robotic arm subscribes to that JSON data in the IBM cloud, Find boxes with 3 or more blocks and register them
6. Publish data to IBM cloud for colors taken and inventory
7. Drop a new box into an empty space
8. Color sorter receives JSON data from IBM cloud
  It reflects the number of blocks in real time.
9. Repeat 5 to 8 times while there are boxes with 3 or more blocks
